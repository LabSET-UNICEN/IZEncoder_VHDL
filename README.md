# IZEncoder_VHDL
VHDL implementation of ImageZero Encoder. This implementation is based on the algorithm ImageZero Fast Lossless Color Image Compression online at http://imagezero.maxiom.de/ by Christoph Feck

The code is “early work in progress”, and neither the image format, nor the outputs interfaces are fully outlined yet.
